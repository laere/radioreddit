      <h1>Upload Your Music</h1>
        <p>
          Greetings fellow musician!  Radio Reddit's music library is made up solely of the music of other Redditors.  Most of
          these musicians are not signed a commercial label, but we welcome music of all types and qualities.  The listeners
          decide what they like by voting, just as with any other Reddit post.  In fact, Radio Reddit uses Reddit itself for
          voting and logins.
         </p>
         <p>
            We recently re-launched Radio Reddit and have not yet finished with the new artists' management area.  As such, you
            cannot upload your music at this time.  We apologize for the ongoing delay, but know that we're working on it
            diligently.  Please check back in a couple weeks.
         </p>
         <p>
            In the mean time, if you have already uploaded music and have an issue (such as you need to take music down, rename
            your band, or need help finding your music), feel free to e-mail us at
            <a href="mailto:admin@radioreddit.com">admin@radioreddit.com</a> and we will try to help you manually.
          </p>
          <p>
          Thank you for your continued patience.
